remove dir with files init
rm -r    (r means recursively)
rm -i    (i means interactive)
rm -f    (f means force - it will remove write protected 			files as well)

move files - mv newfile../newfile
----------
it takes two parameters 
first is the file to be moved (and its location)
second is where the file will be moved to
=====================================================
In one line (using stream redirection), list files, select only the ones with the "txt" extension using grep, then count their number.

Rizwans-MacBook-Pro:~ rizcube$ ls -l|grep .txt|wc -l
Rizwans-MacBook-Pro:~ rizcube$ ls g*|grep git|wc
Rizwans-MacBook-Pro:~ rizcube$ ls *.txt| grep .txt| wc

============================================================
Read through all of the parameter options for the "wc" command (the man page).

wc -- word, line, character, and byte count
wc

The wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained

=======================================
Show the list of environment variables on your system.

set  # displays variables on the system.

variables are dynamic values
gives info about the system behaviour
changes the way system or program behaves

example 
Rizwans-MacBook-Pro:~ rizcube$ echo $LANG
en.GB.UTF-8   - it stores the value of language

ENV - displays all the environment variables

common variable are PATH, USER, HOME, EDITOR, UID, TERM, SHELL, ENV etc
PATH - its a path where system stores its applications

Defining variables and deleting variable - Notes: spacing is not used when defining varaibles
NEWVARIABLE=value123 

Create a new environment variable DAY with the value of the current day of the week.

example


Open a new shell session and check whether the variable still exists.
Solution. It doesn't.

Modify your ~/.bash_profile file to permanently set an env variable and check that it works in a new shell session.

Solution

Show the permissions for "Challenge 1/Text Files/More text".
Solution:   ls -l

===========================================================
chmod  - change modification

User = u, Group =g, other =o
r = read, w = write , execute =x

-r--r--r-- 1

Change permissoin for the folder and the files inside it.
chmod 777 Foldername -R  (r means recursive)


Create a file "Challenge 1/hello.rb" and add the line "puts 'hello, world!'" into it using command line only. Run it by passing its name as an argument to ruby. Make sure it doesn't throw an error.


solution: ruby filename.rb


=====================================================================

List all processes on the system ("ps" command with some extra flags), find out how many processes of Google Chrome are running using grep and wc. Save this number to a file "Challenge 1/chrome.list" using command-line only (redirect the output stream to a file).

solution steps:
1. 
Rizwans-MacBook-Pro:rubyPrograms rizcube$ ps aux | grep chrome
rizcube          7082   0.0  0.0  2432772    640 s000  S+   10:26am   0:00.00 grep chrome

2. 
Rizwans-MacBook-Pro:~ rizcube$ ps |grep chrome > Documents/commandLinePills/chrome_list.txt
Rizwans-MacBook-Pro:~ rizcube$ less Documents/commandLinePills/chrome_list.txt

Rizwans-MacBook-Pro:~ rizcube$ ls -l | grep .txt >> Documents/commandLinePills/chrome_list.txt 
Rizwans-MacBook-Pro:~ rizcube$ less Documents/commandLinePills/chrome_list.txt
